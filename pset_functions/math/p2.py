"""
Permutations & Combinations
"""

# Create two functions:
	# One called "perms", which outputs the **number** of possible **permutations** of rolling two 6-sided dice and assign it to a variable called "permutations".
	# One called "combs", which outputs the **number** of possible **combinations** of rolling two 6-sided dice and assigns it to a variable called "combinations".
	# Hint: The formulas for these are below, where n is the number of possible outcomes for one trial and r is the number of outcomes you will pick at a time. The contextual difference is that order matters for permutations, meaning the same two numbers in a different order count as two unique permutations. For combinations, the order doesn't matter.

# permutation formula = n! / (n-r)!
# combination formula = n! / (nâˆ’r)!r!
