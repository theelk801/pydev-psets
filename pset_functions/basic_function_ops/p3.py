# Now write a and call function called "fave_colors" that separately intakes a person's first name, a person's last name, and **optionally** their favorite color.

# The function should create and return a dict with the full name as a key and the favorite color as the value. If the person does not enter a favorite color, you should assume they have no favorite color and assign theirs to None. Try both use cases.
