"""
Sum of Squares
"""


# Write a function called "sum_squares" that finds the sum of the squares of any number of integers passed into the function.

# For example, someone could enter three individual integers, a list of five integers, or a tuple nested in a list of eight integers.

# Hint: The solution tests out different scenarios, so you can pass those numbers into your function to see if you can get the same answer for different scenarios.
