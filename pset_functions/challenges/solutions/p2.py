# Imagine you're a cop waiting on the side of the road to pick up speeders. Write a function called "speeders" to check the speed of drivers and record their license plate numbers.
## If speed is less than or equal 70 (mph), it should print "Good". 
## If the speed is greater than 70, find the license plate number of that driver in your "driver_points" dict (see below) and add a point to their license for every 5 full mph above the speed limit.
## If at any point that driver has 12 or more points on his/her license, print "License Suspended".
## Call the function on each driver in the "passing_cars" dict below to see difference use cases work.
