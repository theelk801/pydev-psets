"""
Weddings I - Guest List
"""

# Imagine for this problem set that you are planning a wedding. 


# A) Define a class called "Guest" to help you manage all the information about each invitee. This should initially include instance attributes for the guests's name, phone, and an optional "invite_sent" that defaults to False. Guest should also include an instance method called "send_invite()", which changes the value of invite_sent to True once you send an invitation to that guest.



# B) Next, define a child class called "Bridesmaid", which includes the same initial attributes and inherits Guest's instance method.



# C) Finally, create at least one instance of each class and do the following:
### Call send_invite() on each instance.
### Check whether Bridesmaid is a child of Guest and vice versa.
