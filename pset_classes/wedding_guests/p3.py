Weddings III - Record Shower & Bachelorette RSVP
"""

# Create two methods in Bridesmaid to record a the bridesmaid's rsvp to the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. You can call them "record_shower_rsvp()" and "record_bachelorette_rsvp()". They will work just like the general "record_rsvp()" except there will be no plus ones or diet questions. Their rsvp answers should be stored in instance attributes with the same name (i.e. shower_rsvp & bachelorette_rsvp).
