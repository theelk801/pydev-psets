Weddings II - Record Bridesmaid RSVPs
"""

# Create a method in Guest to record a guests's rsvp to your invitation. It should record whether they have any dietary restrictions (e.g. vegetarian, kosher, halal, etc.) and whether they're bringing a plus one. If they are bringing a plus one, it should record the name of the plus one and his/her dietary restrictions if any. These values should be stored in instance attributes.

# Try out this method on at least one instance of Guest and at least one instance of Bridesmaid.
