# Create an "Account" class to represent unique bank accounts. Ensure that when you create a new instance of Account, that instances has attributes for the bank account number, account owner's name, and the initial balance. It should have a class attribute for the default interest rate on a general account. Add an instance method called "acc_details" that prints out all these account details. Then create at least once instance and print out its details.
