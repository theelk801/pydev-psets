"""
Dogs I - Breeds
""" 

# A) Create a class called "Dog". It should include: 
### A class attribute "domesticated" w. value True
### An instance method called "bark()" that prints "Woof!"

# B) Create child class for 3 dog breeds - Collie, Siberian Husky, and Pekingese. Each should have:
### 2 class attributes for "breed" and "temperament". The latter should be a list.
### 3 instance attributes for "name", "age", and "gender".

# C) Add an instance method to Collie called "herd_the_kids()" that prints "Here are your children!"

# D) Add an instance method called "bark()" to Pekingese. This should override the parent method "bark()" such that when you call bark() on an instance of Pekingese, it prints "Yap!" instead.

# E) Instantiate one of each breed. Access the attributes, methods, and parent methods of each one. BONUS: Aside from herd_the_kids(), you should be able to do this in a loop.
