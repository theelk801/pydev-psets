RGB to HEX
"""

# Remember our function "rgb_hex" from the functions pset? That function took a color in rgb format and returned it in hex format as well as vice versa. Wouldn't it be so much easier to do that with a class called Color?

# Define a class called "Color" to store each color's rgb and hex values. Define a method called "convert_codes()" to retrieve one value given the other. Create at least one instance of Color and try the convert_codes() method.
