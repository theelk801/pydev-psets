Vehicles I

# Create a "Vehicle" class with a class attribute for category ('transportion') and a method called "start_engine()" that prints "Vroom!". Add "name" as an instance method and instantiate a Vehicle called "submarine". Access all its attributes and methods for practice.

# Note: See Vehicles II in p6 for an explanation of why we chose "submarine" as a vehicle instance!
