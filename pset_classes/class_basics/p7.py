# Let's expand the Car class to be more comprehensive. Include attributes for brand name, plates, owner, fuel, fuel_level (a numerical amount that defaults to 50, and max speed in MPH that defaults to None. 

# Next, define new method called "check_fuel_level()". If the fuel_level attribute is < 15, the method should reset fuel_level to 50 and print out how many units it refueled the car, e.g. 'Refueled 38 units.' Otherwise, it should simply print 'No need to refuel right now.'

# Create at least TWO instances of Car, one of which has a fuel level below 15. Access the new attributes and call the check_fuel_level() method for each instance.
