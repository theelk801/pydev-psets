# Print the numbers in the range (5:12) until you find a factor of 4. If the range the user enters contains no factors of 4, print "There are no factors of 4 in this interval."
# HINT: for the range 5,12 there will likely be multiples of 4 present - to assert the final requirement, try changing range boundaries
